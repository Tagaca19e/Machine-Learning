Machine learning types:

Supervised
Unsupervised 
reinforcement


Supervised -> expects output
Unsupervised -> does not expect output (Discover itself) no teachers 



Anaconda -> Anaconda navigator->Jupyter(a notebook)

IMPORTING DATA SETS with python

From sklearn import datasets -> sklearn is a module for machine learning

Algorithm types:
Classification Algorithm -> answers the questions: what type? 
Anomaly Detection Algorithm -> detects unusual behaviors, what is the outlier or unusual?
Clustering Algorithm -> To segregate groups, What group does it belong to?
Regression Algorithm -> it allows you to predict the outcome by standard error. 


Jupyter part 1:

Import sys, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, sklearn

Sys is just for python


To read a CSV source

source  = ‘your link to the source’
names = [‘col1’, ‘col2’, ‘col3’, ‘col4’] -> this will be the names for the columns of your data set
df = p.read_csv(source, names=names) -> this will read the source and make the names as the columns
Df = dataframe

Df.shape = results in the number of rows and columns 
df.head(30) -> shows the data until the 30th row

df.groupby(‘nameOfCol’).size() -> To group by class(the type of column) 

Creating a boxplot:

df.plot (kind=’box’, subplot=True, layout=(2,2), sharex = False, sharey=False)

subplot = multiple boxes or each box for each plot
layout = the layout of the result
sharex  = if you want to share your x axis with other plots
Sharey = if you want to share your y axis with other plots


df.hist() -> creating a histogram for the data


Blue = command mode
Green = edit mode

H = list for help keyboard shortcuts 

Command mode + b = new cell below the current cell
Command mode + a = new cell above the current cell
Command mode + dd = delete a cell

Cell section -> click run all = this will run all the code for the file

Tab to see the intellisense 

shift + tab = to see the purpose of the function and the parameter it takes also do not forget to put cursor on the function


command + / = comment
